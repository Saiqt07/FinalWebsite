- Self-assessment tools to evaluate current screen usage
- Goal-setting worksheets for healthy screen time limits
- Daily and weekly screen time tracking templates
- Strategies for reducing excessive screen time
- Alternative activity suggestions
- Progress tracking charts
- Research-backed information on the benefits of balanced screen time
