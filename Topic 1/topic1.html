                            <p>Digital wellness refers to the state of well-being that an individual achieves by maintaining a healthy and balanced relationship with technology. It encompasses the mindful and intentional use of digital devices and platforms to enhance rather than detract from one's physical, mental, and emotional health.</p>

                            <p>Digital wellness is not about rejecting technology, but rather about developing a conscious approach to how we integrate digital tools into our lives. It involves creating boundaries, practicing mindful usage, and ensuring that technology serves as a tool for enhancement rather than a source of distraction or stress.</p>

                            <h3>Why Digital Wellness Matters</h3>
                            <p>In today's hyperconnected world, we spend an unprecedented amount of time interacting with digital devices. Research shows that the average person checks their smartphone over 150 times per day and spends more than 7 hours daily on screens. This constant digital engagement has profound effects on our:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Excessive screen time and social media use have been linked to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation.
                                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;">
                                        <li>Studies show that limiting social media use to 30 minutes per day can significantly reduce depression and loneliness.</li>
                                        <li>Digital comparison behaviors on social platforms can decrease self-esteem by up to 50% in vulnerable populations.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Physical Health:</strong> Prolonged device use contributes to sedentary behavior, eye strain, poor posture, and disrupted sleep patterns.
                                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;">
                                        <li>Blue light exposure from screens can suppress melatonin production by up to 50% when used within 2 hours of bedtime.</li>
                                        <li>"Text neck" from looking down at devices can add up to 60 pounds of pressure on the cervical spine.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Cognitive Function:</strong> Constant digital distractions can impair focus, reduce productivity, and diminish our ability to engage in deep thinking.
                                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;">
                                        <li>Research indicates it takes an average of 23 minutes to refocus after a digital interruption.</li>
                                        <li>Heavy multitaskers experience a 15% decrease in IQ during cognitive tasks, similar to the effects of sleep deprivation.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Social Relationships:</strong> When digital interactions replace face-to-face connections, the quality and depth of our relationships may suffer.
                                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;">
                                        <li>Studies show that conversations without devices present demonstrate 35% more empathetic concern.</li>
                                        <li>The mere presence of a phone during in-person interactions reduces feelings of closeness and trust by approximately 20%.</li>
